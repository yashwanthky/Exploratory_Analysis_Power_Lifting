# Exploratory Analysis on Power Lifting
Analyze the various factors affecting the ability of the person to do power-lifting. This project is all about understanding this exciting and intense sport better

## What is Power-lifting?

Powerlifting is the ultimate strength competition. The International Powerlifting Federation is the head of nearly 100 country federations world-wide. The powerlifts:- squat, bench press and deadlift are increasingly being recognized as principal exercises in the development of an individual’s true strength. But, analyzing the factors affecting the power lifts forms the core of this project.

## Problem Statement:

Analyze the various factors affecting the ability of the person to do power-lifting. This project is all about understanding this exciting and intense sport better.

Key questions that will be answered in this project are -

* How is the weight lifted by a person being impacted by age?
* How is the weight lifted by a person being impacted by gender?
* Is age impacting the equipment being used to do powerlifting?
* Which section of people are more likely to get disqualified?
* How is age impacting different types of lifts such as bench, deadlift and squat?
* How is gender impacting different types of lifts such as bench, deadlift and squat?
* Is there a relationship between bodyweight and position?
* How is the gender split in different meets? Is it changing over the years?
* What is the distribution of different age classes in the meets? How it varies over the years?
* Is the participation increasing over the years?
* Is the average weight lifted increasing over the years?

## Solution Overview/ Approach:

We will be using a subset of the International Powerlifting Data in this project. Once we are done with the tedious but necessary task of data cleaning, we plan to perform univariate/ multi-variate analysis of the various attributes affecting the performance of the individual.We will also look at scatter plots and histograms broken down by multiple filters to be able to visually comprehend the influence of different attributes on the performance. We will also perform hypothesis testing to see if few of the relationships are statistically significant.

Finally, the relation will be explained with the help of a regression model which will give us a mathematical equation of the relationship between independent variables such as age, gender, body weight with the response variable - “ability to lift” across different divisions and world wide meets.

In short - this report aims to equip the consumer with the ability to guesstimate and be able to explain the lifting capacity of an individual, when provided with certain basic data points such as gender, age, bodyweight etc.
